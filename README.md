**CareerHub**
================

**Overview**
------------

CareerHub is a portal for candidates and recruiters to recruit/get placed painlessly. It provides a platform for recruiters to post job/internship opportunities, and candidates to apply. The backend uses Supabase, Groq AI, and HuggingFace to analyze and match candidates with opportunities, while also providing tech support and scam detection.

**How it Works**

1. Recruiters post job/internship opportunities on the platform.
2. Candidates apply for the opportunities.
3. The backend uses Supabase to store and manage the data.
4. Groq AI is used to analyze and tag the opportunities and candidate profiles thoroughly.
5. HuggingFace is used to detect scams and make recruitment easier.
6. FastAPI is used to provide a fast and secure API for the React frontend.
7. React JS is used to build the frontend Single-Page Application (SPA).
